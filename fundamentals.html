                            <p>The team that can dink consistently controls the pace. Dinking forces opponents to stay patient and creates opportunities when they pop the ball up. Most points at intermediate+ levels are won or lost during the dinking exchange.</p>

                                <li><strong>Patience:</strong> Wait for your opponent's mistake rather than forcing winners</li>
                                <li><strong>Footwork first:</strong> Position determines control more than paddle technique</li>

                            <p><strong>Cooperative Dinking:</strong> With a partner, aim for 20+ consecutive dinks without errors. Start stationary, then add lateral movement. Track your longest streak. Advanced: Add crosscourt angles and varying depths within the kitchen.</p>

                                <li>Standing too far back - you should be just behind the kitchen line</li>
                                <li>Looking at the paddle - watch the ball all the way to contact</li>
                                <li>Trying to end points too early - the best dink is the one that comes back</li>

                            <p>The kitchen line is the strongest position in pickleball. It gives you offensive angles and lets you cut off balls early. Moving in sync with your partner prevents gaps. Players who retreat unnecessarily get punished.</p>

                            <p><strong>Shadow Movement:</strong> With your partner, practice moving side-to-side without a ball. Call out "together!" as you shift. Video record to verify you're actually staying parallel. Advanced: Add random feeds to react to while maintaining sync.</p>

                These skills elevate your game once primary skills are solid (70%+ consistency).
                They add variety, power, and tactical options but won't help if fundamentals are weak.

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">A mediocre serve with good positioning beats a great serve with poor follow-up. But once your fundamentals are solid, serve variety keeps opponents guessing and can create immediate advantages.</p>

                                <li><strong>Deep to backhand:</strong> Most players' weaker side</li>
                                <li><strong>Body serve:</strong> Jams opponent, limits options</li>
                                <li><strong>Short angle serve:</strong> Pulls opponent wide</li>
                                <li><strong>Pace variation:</strong> Mix hard and soft serves</li>

                            <p>Place targets in different serve zones. Practice 10 serves to each target. Track accuracy by zone. Mix up pace and spin on each serve type.</p>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">When opponents pop the ball up above net level, you need to punish it. Speedups (attacking high balls with pace) and counters (defending against them) are critical for advanced play.</p>

                        <div class="key-points">
                            <h4>Speedup Principles</h4>

                                <li><strong>Target feet:</strong> Aim at opponent's feet or body</li>
                                <li><strong>Downward angle:</strong> Hit down on the ball</li>
                                <li><strong>Quick hands:</strong> Short, punchy swing</li>
                                <li><strong>Stay balanced:</strong> Don't overswing and fall into kitchen</li>

                                <li>Attacking balls that aren't truly high - patience is key</li>
                                <li>Hitting too hard and losing control</li>
                                <li>Failing to reset when the speedup comes back</li>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">A well-timed lob forces aggressive opponents back, gives you time to reset position, and can win points outright. But overuse signals weak fundamentals.</p>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Topspin and slice serves are legal again. They can be effective but require significant practice. Most players overinvest here relative to the fundamentals that actually win games.</p>
